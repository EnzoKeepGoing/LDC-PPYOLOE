## overview

In this colloection, four main citruses were captured in the Chinese Guangxi Province, Guilin Lingui County, called “Kumquat”, “Nanfeng”,” Fertile” and “Shatang”. To understand the citrus cultivation growth process, the characteristics of the process that are changed by environmental factors are learned by the model. From the spring citrus fruiting in 2020, until the autumn citrus fruit ripening. Images were captured at 9:00 am, 11:00 am and 2:00 pm. We went to the citrus fields to capture images 2 times a week and 4 times a day. Utilizing the Camera for capturing images perpendicular to the ground. Four images of citrus trees were captured from four different orientations to obtain the color and environmental changes of the citrus fruit under different sunlight exposure angles. At the same time, to better simulate a real environment, we captured the citrus tree images in cloudy weather. Finally, a total of 500 images of Kumquat, 115 images of Nanfeng, 300 images of Fertile, and 116 images of Shatang were collected. All these images are stored in the JPG format. After the raw images were analyzed, large differences in the phenotypic characteristics were found between the citrus growing and ripening stages. During growth, the shape appears oval, and the citrus peel is rough. Its color is similar to that of the leaves of the citrus fruit trees. At the ripening stage, the citrus is spherical and flattened, with a smooth surface. Its color appears orange or greenish-yellow, as shown in
In addition, two different kinds of fruit datasets are prepared in this experiment, 168 images of apples grown in Prosser West Virginia the USA, and 118 images of passion fruit grown in Chinese Guangxi Province Guilin Lingui County. The image resolutions are 5312x2988 pixels and 5760*3840 pixels, respectively. To save CPU resources and speed up the training, the images are compressed to 1440x960 pixels and then enhanced in the offline stat.
